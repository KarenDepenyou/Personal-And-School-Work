		<h3>*MIKO</h3>
		<p>Our main goal in creating both the game and the website Veggie Run, was to make it fun for people  to learn a little about health. Before creating Veggie Run, we noticed that health was a major issue that millions of americans faced. People typically shy away from the green foods, and indulge in fried foods. We designed this game to make vegetables a little more friendly and for little kids to associate positive things to healthy eating</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>*Girls Who Code</h3>
		<p>We all met and began creating Veggie Run at a summer immersion program called Girls Who Code. This is where we learned what coding was and how we could all change the world one line of code of at a time. We all agree that this was an unforgettable summer full of new experiences. We would like to thank our teachers Shannon, Ashwini, and Emily, who taught us how to code. We would also like to thank our friends and family for their support. Another big thank you to both Georgetown University and LockHeed Martin for hosting and sponsoring us during our summer program </p> <p><button><a class= "btn" href= "https://girlswhocode.com/"> Visit GWC Site</a></button> <button><a class= "btn" href= "https://www.georgetown.edu/"> Visit GT Site</a></button> <button><a class= "btn" href= "http://www.lockheedmartin.com/"> Visit LM Site</a></button></p>
